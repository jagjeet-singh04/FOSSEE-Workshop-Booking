# Workshop Booking â€“ UI/UX Enhancement

## Introduction
This repository contains my submission for **Python Screening Task 1**, focused on enhancing the UI/UX of the workshop booking portal.

The original site was functional but minimal. The goal of this enhancement was to improve the overall user experienceâ€”especially for students accessing the portal on mobile devicesâ€”while keeping the core Django structure intact.

## Project Overview
This project enhances the Django-based workshop booking portal used by coordinators and instructors.

### Key Goals
- Improve usability and accessibility on small screens
- Refine visual hierarchy and navigation
- Keep the interface lightweight and fast-loading

**Reference Repository:** [FOSSEE/workshop_booking](https://github.com/FOSSEE/workshop_booking)

## Task Objective
- Enhance the look and feel of the existing portal
- Improve readability, navigation, and accessibility
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness
- Maintain fast load times with minimal dependencies
- Provide a professional, consistent interface

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FOSSEE/workshop_booking.git
cd workshop_booking
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Apply Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Open in Browser
```

```

## Technical Approach

### Languages/Tools
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Frameworks
- Bootstrap 5 (responsive layout)
- Material Icons (iconography)

### Enhancements
- Toastr (feedback messages)
- Chart.js (visualization)

### Performance Constraints
- Bootstrap CDN for styling
- Minimal JS libraries (only Chart.js + Toastr)
- Optimized images and static assets
- Avoided heavy animations for smooth performance

## UX & Design Reasoning

### Guiding Principles
- Mobile-first design with Bootstrap grid + custom media queries
- Accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Consistency in colors, buttons, and typography
- Feedback via clear error messages & toast notifications
- Visual hierarchy through spacing, contrast, and structured headings

### Responsiveness Across Devices
- Tested layouts on multiple screen sizes
- Bootstrap utility classes for flexibility
- Custom tweaks for small screens
- Touch-friendly forms, tables, and modals

### Design vs Performance Trade-offs
- Used CDN-hosted Bootstrap for speed
- Restricted libraries to Chart.js + Toastr
- Optimized static assets
- Avoided unnecessary animations

### Biggest Challenge & Solution
- **Challenge:** Making Django templates fully accessible while handling dynamic data.
- **Solution:**
  - Refactored templates with semantic HTML
  - Passed data safely using JSON script tags
  - Added ARIA attributes for accessibility
  - Tested all UI components (charts, paginators, dropdowns) with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Visual Showcase


### Before vs After
- **Before:**
  - Minimal, non-responsive UI
  - Limited accessibility
  - Basic navigation and feedback
- **After:**
  - Modern, mobile-first design
  - Accessible forms, tables, and navigation
  - Interactive charts and notifications

<!-- # Workshop Booking – UI/UX Enhancement Submission

## Project Overview
This project is a Django-based workshop booking portal for coordinators and instructors. The goal of this enhancement was to improve the user experience and interface design, especially for students accessing the site on mobile devices, while keeping the core structure intact.

---

## Task Objective
Enhance the look and feel of the basic website, focusing on:
- Readability and navigation on small screens
- Visual hierarchy and user flow
- Fast load times and accessibility

---

## Design Principles & Reasoning
### 1. What design principles guided your improvements?
- **Mobile-first design:** All layouts and components are optimized for mobile screens using Bootstrap 5 and custom media queries.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation are implemented for all interactive elements.
- **Visual hierarchy:** Clear headings, color contrast, and spacing guide users through the site.
- **Consistency:** Unified color palette, button styles, and iconography (Material Icons) for a professional look.
- **Feedback:** Toastr notifications and clear error messages provide instant feedback.

### 2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?
- Used Bootstrap 5 grid and utility classes for flexible layouts.
- Added custom media queries for fine-tuned mobile adjustments.
- Tested navigation, forms, and tables on various screen sizes.
- Ensured all buttons, dropdowns, and modals are touch-friendly and accessible.

### 3. What trade-offs did you make between the design and performance?
- Chose Bootstrap CDN for fast, reliable styling without heavy custom CSS.
- Limited use of external JS libraries to Chart.js and Toastr for essential interactivity.
- Optimized images and static assets for quick load times.
- Avoided excessive animations to maintain performance on low-end devices.

### 4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?
- **Challenge:** Making legacy Django templates fully accessible and interactive, especially with dynamic data and template tags in JS.
- **Approach:** Refactored templates to use semantic HTML, added ARIA attributes, and handled empty data gracefully. Used JSON script tags for safe JS data passing. Debugged and tested all interactive elements (charts, paginator, profile dropdown) for keyboard and screen reader accessibility.

# Python Screening Task 1: UI/UX Enhancement  

This repository contains my submission for **Python Screening Task 1**, which focuses on enhancing the **UI/UX** of the workshop booking portal.  
The original site was functional but quite minimal. My goal was to **improve the overall user experience**—especially for students accessing the portal on **mobile devices**—while keeping the core structure intact.  

---

## 🎯 Task Objective  
- Enhance the look and feel of the existing website.  
- Improve **readability, navigation, and accessibility** on small screens.  
- Ensure **visual hierarchy, performance, and fast load times**.  
- Maintain a consistent, professional interface with minimal but effective enhancements.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

To set up and run the project locally:  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FOSSEE/workshop_booking.git
cd workshop_booking

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
Now open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.

⚙️ Technical Approach
Languages/Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: Bootstrap 5 (for responsive layout), Material Icons (for consistent iconography)

Enhancements: Toastr (feedback messages), Chart.js (visualization)

Constraints: Kept external dependencies minimal to ensure fast load times

📱 UX Focus
Since most users are students accessing via mobile devices, I prioritized:

✅ Easy readability on small screens

✅ Mobile-friendly navigation and buttons

✅ Clear visual hierarchy and guided user flow

✅ Accessibility (ARIA roles, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)

✅ Lightweight design for quick loading, even on low-end devices

💡 Design Reasoning
1. Principles that guided the improvements
Mobile-first design using Bootstrap grid + custom media queries

Accessibility with ARIA roles and keyboard support

Consistency in color palette, buttons, and typography

Feedback through clear error messages and toast notifications

Visual hierarchy using spacing, contrast, and clear headings

2. Ensuring responsiveness across devices
Tested layouts on multiple screen sizes

Used Bootstrap utility classes for flexibility

Added custom tweaks for mobile-first design

Ensured forms, tables, and modals remain touch-friendly

3. Design vs. performance trade-offs
Used Bootstrap CDN for quick, reliable styling

Restricted JS libraries to only Chart.js + Toastr

Optimized assets (images, static files)

Avoided heavy animations to keep performance smooth

4. Biggest challenge and how I solved it
Challenge: Making Django templates fully accessible while handling dynamic data safely.

Approach: Refactored templates to semantic HTML, used JSON script tags for passing data into JS, added ARIA attributes, and tested all components (charts, paginator, dropdowns) with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
